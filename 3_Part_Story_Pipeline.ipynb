    "- When you use this function, you can provide a \"prompt\" as input, which is basically a specific topic or idea for the scary story. If you give it a prompt, the function takes that prompt and creates a story prompt based on it. This prompt includes a request to write the beginning of a realistic scary story (around 4000 characters long) that's told from a first-person perspective. The topic you provided will be a part of this story prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, if you don't provide a prompt, the function reads from a file called \"story_topics.csv.\" This file contains different story topics, some of which might have been used before and some that haven't been used yet. The function looks for the next unused story topic in this file and extracts it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, similar to the prompt case, the function builds a story prompt using this extracted topic. It's the same request: write the beginning of a 4000-character scary story, told in the first person, based on this topic. Additionally, the function marks the extracted topic as \"used\" by changing a \"Published\" column in the file to \"True.\" This helps keep track of which topics have been used already.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the updated list of story topics is saved back to the \"story_topics.csv\" file, so that next time, the function knows which topics have been used and which ones are still available."

The `openai.ChatCompletion.create` method is used to generate a response from the model based on this message. The model used for generation is `gpt-3.5-turbo`. The response (reply) from the model is extracted and added to the `story_text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generating the Ending**: The generated reply is added to the `messages` list as an assistant's message.

The response generated by the model is again extracted and added to the `story_text`.\n",

I marveled at how the beats seemed to drive people into a frenzy. Dressed in all my finery, I pressed deeper, eager to get closer to the stage. The crush of people intensified as I pushed forward.

In those first moments, I was too carried away by the music to pay much attention to what\n",
      "ChatGPT: As the show progressed, an unsettling feeling grew within me. The lights that had seemed so magical before now seemed to pulse in wicked patterns that seemed all too familiar. The music took a dark turn, and suddenly I found myself surrounded by people lost in a kind of frenzied desperation. The lyrics shifted into something insidious, containing a powerful command, driving the audience like puppets on strings. I tried to cover my ears, but the music was somehow everywhere. And then I saw it ‚Äì behind the lead artist, dark shadows writhed, their vague forms wreathed in smoke.\n",

The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, surrounded by strangers trying to help me. They looked like they were made of shadows, with thick tendrils of fog streaming from their bodies. I knew I had to get out of there. Somehow. \n",

      "Days have passed since the concert and the memory of the shadowy figures still haunts me. I can't shake off the feeling that they had intended to harm me or worse. Friends warned into attendance defense and warrant I report the event to the authorities, scared for whatever evil might have tainted that concert. No longer certain what happened at that show, I can only speculate that something sinister must have taken place, hidden behind the veil of sound and light. And I fear I may never again find sanctuary within the calms of a music concert.\n",

      "ChatGPT: I had always dreamed of going to a massive live music concert. The thrill of being surrounded by thousands of people, all singing and swaying to the power of the music was an experience I absolutely had to have. So when I heard that Debora Ambrose, my favorite rock musician, was going to perform at the local arena, I knew that I had to be there. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got myself a ticket and counted down the days and weeks until D-Day. Finally, the day arrived, and I psyched myself up for what I was sure would be the greatest night of my life. I put on my best outfit, hopped into my car, and made my way to the arena as early as possible. I didn't want to miss a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parking lot was a chaotic mess of vehicles and excited people. I could hear fragments of Debora's music floating through the air already, electricity making my heart race. I found a spot and hurried into the crowds of fans hurrying towards the singing songs.\n",

      "The arena was massive, and I couldn't believe how full it was. There were thousands of people all over the place, a sea of humans in various stages of revelry. The scintillating lights of the concert stage were a sight to behold, and the excitement was palpable in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The band started their first song, and as soon as the audience roared in approval, I could feel my whole body resonating with the same energy. The bustling sounds of the crowd, surrounded by a fantastic melody; it was transcendental.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, soon there were a few things that started bothering me. There was a low murmur that filled the arena between song breaks; chatter between songs that sounded strange in comparison to the pumped-up anthems and energetic crowd roar. It took me a few minutes to realize that mixed in with the humdrum of the listeners were whispers. They were hard to discern, indistinct as if muffled from a considerable distance, but soon I realized they were different altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw that the whispers didn't come to a pause, even when the music was incredibly loud or when large portions of the crowd were singing along. Tension began to grow in my stomach, slowly\n",
      "ChatGPT: building, and as the concert went on, the whispers started to become more and more distinct. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but it sounded like a chant, a solemn chorus that seemed to echo through the entire arena.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started looking around me, trying to identify where the whispers were coming from, but all I could see were people singing and bouncing with cheerful abandon. The whispers were everywhere, teasing me, mocking me. I began to feel disoriented, unable to distinguish between what was real and what was illusory. My muscles began to tighten with dread. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, the lights on the stage started flickering and then dimmed out entirely. I heard a massive sound of something shattering, heard the clamor of panicking voices. Suddenly, I was trapped amidst a squirming throng of attendees all trying to push their way towards the exit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that I caught glimpse in of the corner of my eye: a ghostly apparition looming over the crowd. Translucent, the fluttered over all of those screaming for safety. It garbled something incoherent, yet somehow driving me to panic even more massive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dark chaos of people shoving and trampling, I lost my balance, falling on the ground in throbbing pain. I smelt burning hair and felt a sharp impact on my face. Gets cooler then it opens to dark cloudy sky, and I look down at overcome with fear with the realization, it was now me, unstuck in time, was one of those echoes cursed to spend the rest of time haunting that cursed concert, adding to the ceaseless chorus of deafening whispers ringing in the ears of those trapped by their greed for music. \n",
      "\n",
      "And now, as the years stretched into immeasurable generations, I was still there, my chant and my curses distilled into an incredibly distinct whisper of which nobody except the endless darkness could still hear.\n"

    "Here's an explanation of the function `clean_chunk_save`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Signature and Description**: The function is named `clean_chunk_save`. It takes three parameters: `story_dict`, a dictionary containing stories; `extracted_topic`, a string representing the topic of the stories; and an optional parameter `n` with a default value of 4999, which represents the desired chunk length. The purpose of the function is to clean the text in the stories, break them into smaller chunks, save the chunks as .txt files, and return the updated story dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining Filepaths**: The function begins by defining two filepaths, `filepath` and `text_filepath`, for organizing the saved data files. These paths are based on the provided `extracted_topic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Directories**: It then creates two directories using the defined filepaths: the main directory and the text directory. The `os.mkdir` function is used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterating Over Stories**: The function iterates through each story in the provided `story_dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cleaning the Story**: For each story, it calls a function `remove_newlines_backslashes` to clean the text by removing newlines and backslashes. The cleaned text is stored in `story_text_cleaned`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Chunking the Text**: The cleaned text is then passed to a function called `chunk_text`, along with the desired chunk length `n`. The purpose of this is to break the story into smaller chunks of approximately the specified length.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Updating the Dictionary**: The resulting chunks are reassigned to the corresponding story in the `story_dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Saving Chunks to Files**: The function saves the first chunk of each story as a .txt file in the text directory. It iterates through the stories, creates a file named based on the index, and writes the content of the first chunk to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Saving Dictionary as JSON**: After processing all stories, the function saves the updated `story_dict` as a JSON file named 'cleaned_story_dict.json' using the `json.dumps` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Returning the Updated Dictionary**: Finally, the function returns the `story_dict` after processing and saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `clean_chunk_save` function takes a dictionary of stories, cleans their text by removing specific characters, divides them into smaller chunks, saves the chunks as .txt files in directories based on the topic, and returns the updated dictionary. This function is useful for organizing and preprocessing a collection of stories for further analysis or use."

It uses image prompts, story titles, and corresponding audio to construct a narrative video. The final video is then written to a specified file location."
